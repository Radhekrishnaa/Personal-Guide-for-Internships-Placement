All views are my own, my observations, and experiences, and the things i learnt from talking ,reading and listening other people's stories and advices.

This are the content covered in this repository:

## 1.General Offcampus Application Process -

Almost every company has a careers page. You can find it by just googling ``` CompanyName Careers. ``` They usually post their openings here. And applicants apply for these openings through the respective careers site. The Recruiters see these applications and shortlist the resumes/profiles that they like and then those candidates are called for interviews.

But Wait, Do you think that the Recruiters would be going through thousands and thousands of resumes to shortlist submitted directly through the careers portal? ***Maybe Not!***

Now there are 2 things added in the scenario -
1. **ATS(Applicant Tracking Software) Filtering -** This is used to automatically filter Resumes. Heard the term ATS-friendly Resumes?
2. **Referrals -** The people working at the company currently can refer their connections whom they believe would be a great fit for the role. The referred applications are treated as priority applications and those applications are most probably reviewed.\
Both the above things increase your chances of getting shortlisted for the next rounds.\

## 2.Where to ask for Referrals?
1. Linkedin
2. Twitter
3. College Seniors
4. Relatives/bhaiyaa\
Search the people working in XYZ company and text them to ask for refer your profile in their company.

***How not to ask for Referrals?***
```hlw, can you refer me
hi, can i ask a question
Hi Sir, I came to know that --- is hiring, can you refer me there?` 
Can u help me for search job?
```
***How to ask for Referrals?*** \
Few important things to know -
1. Don't use the WhatsApp ways ðŸ˜¬ - u, plz, hlp, ur, hlw.
2. Send the Job Id/Job Link - It's not the responsibility of a Software Engineer to find the right job for you. Please don't expect them to search a relevant job for your profile.
3. Don't forget to attach your Resume
4. Don't text XYZ company employees for referral in ABC company ðŸ˜¬
5. Be respectful and polite. - Respect the time of the other person.\
So, The deal is - Not all employees are active on Linkedin and those who are active again might be getting hundreds of messages from so many people. So, you gotta catch their attention with your message and skills :p .\
Tips to write just the right message -
- Include your graduation year/YOE whichever is applicable.
- A little about your skills/expertise area.
- Mention your previous internships/experiences/projects.
- And of course, the Job Id for which you want a referral.
- Not too long to read, Not too short like the ones in the above section.\
I am attaching a couple of examples to give you a better idea -
